# Tweetinvi - Xamarin for iOS

This is a very simple iOS application that uses Tweetinvi to access the `AuthenticatedUser` and his `Timeline`.

To start working on this project please open the file `ViewController.cs` and simply enter your credentials at the line:

`Auth.SetUserCredentials("CONSUMER_KEY", "CONSUMER_SECRET", "ACCESS_TOKEN", "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET");`
